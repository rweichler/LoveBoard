This is the game that is run when LoveBoard is hooked. It is the same as the game that is found in `/var/mobile/LoveBoard`.

This can also be run as a standalone Love2D game on desktop. Just open LÃ–VE.app with this repository.

# Requirements

* [Love2D](http://love2d.org)

# Running this

Drag and drop this folder onto `love.exe`, `love.app`, or whatever.

Or, if you have LuaJIT installed, just run it with `main.lua`.

OR, if you're on iOS, just install the LoveBoard tweak from the [http://cydia.r333d.com](http://cydia.r333d.com) repo.
